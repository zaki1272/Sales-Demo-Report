## Sales-Demo-Report
#### This Power BI report shows various KPIs related to sales of an online retail store. The KPIs are related to revenue, orders, customers, RFM analysis, time intelligence, and much more. I have added several tabs to the report where each one has a specific purpose. For example, there is one page called 'Dashboard' which gives an overall summary of how the store is actually performing. 

#### The data used for this report has been extracted by writing scripts in Python and then transformed using data build tool (dbt). This transformed data was then connected to Power BI Desktop where the report was created.
